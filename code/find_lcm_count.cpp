1. factorize n,
2. n can be written as in the form of  p1^ (K1) * P2 ^ (K2) ........ PM * (km)
3. Then the answer is ((2k1 +1) * (2k2 +1) * ....... (2km +1) +1) / 2.
4. Its principle is separately for each factor to see 2 * k +1, and then for each factor.
5. Multiplying all factors, so that the last draw answers, each pair calculated twice (addition <n,n> the),
6.  the final answer (ANS +1) / 2;
